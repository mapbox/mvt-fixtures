<p>Implementations of the Mapbox Vector Tile Specification are far and wide. Many of them fall into one of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parsers &amp; generators: libraries that read and/or encode vector tiles, some also have command line utilities</li>
  <li>Clients: web-based tools that render vector tiles that conform to the specification</li>
  <li>Applications: browser-based tools for creating and visualizing vector tiles</li>
  <li>Servers: support rendering and serving up vector tiles (<em>note: the specification doesnâ€™t go into how to do this explicitly</em>)</li>
</ul>
