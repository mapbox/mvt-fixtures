<p>Vector tiles are encoded as <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Google Protobufs</a> (PBF), which allow for serializing structured data. For clarity, Mapbox Vector Tiles use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.mvt</code> file suffix. The specification details are largely structured around the rules implemented in the base <code class="highlighter-rouge">.proto</code> file found <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1/vector_tile.proto">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-osm-pbf-files-related-to-mapbox-vector-tiles">How are OSM PBF files related to Mapbox Vector Tiles?</h3>

<p>They are not related at all. PBFs are a format, much like XML and can take many forms. Mapbox Vector Tiles and OSM PBFs are protobuf files, but conform to completely different specifications and are used in different ways.</p>
