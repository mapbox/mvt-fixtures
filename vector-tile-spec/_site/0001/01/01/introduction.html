<p>A specification is an important means of setting standards around how data are created and encoded. Just like applications make assumptions about what information exist in a database, Mapbox tools make assumptions about how data are stored in vector tiles. The specification explicitly provides information about file formats &amp; extensions, projection and bounds, and the internal structure of vector tiles. This page aims to shed some light on the specification with</p>
